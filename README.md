# NBA Player Performance Prediction 🏀📊

This predictive analytics project uses NBA player statistics to build machine learning models that reveal performance trends and classify players based on scoring metrics.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- R
- RStudio
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression, SVM, K-Means Clustering)
- Data Cleaning and EDA

## 🔍 Models Used
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Analyzed the relationship between assists and points.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Classified players as high or low scorers using the median points.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Grouped players based on assists, rebounds, and field goals to find performance patterns.

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- Identified linear trends between playmaking and scoring abilities.
- Built a basic classifier to differentiate top scorers.
- Segmented players into clusters with similar attributes for performance profiling.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to my mentor **Maneet Kaur** for guidance throughout the project.
